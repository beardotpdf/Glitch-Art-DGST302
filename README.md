# Glitch-Art-DGST302
Glitch Art gallery for DGST 302

My focus for this project was to create glitch art based around a parakeet named Perry, a small lemon colored bird treated as god-like within my interent friend group.
The techniques used for all of these images was to convert the original pictures from jpgs into bmps, import them into audacity and blindly edit the resulting audio.
After this blind editing the raw data was exported and treated as an image within a pixel sorting program written in python. The permutations of the pixel sorting algorithm included running it repeatedly in sequence via different algorithm settings.
I found great enjoyment from focusing on flat textural pieces, sorting the color within images of noise.
